# Copy this file into a `.env` file. (Do not rename this file itself).
# If you're running esimport against localstack, using the included docker-compose.yml file
# You'll probably need these values as they are.
# For more info on what you can put here, refer to: `esimport/core/config.py` for the complete list 
# of the available configs. Note that the config class in `esimport/core/config.py` will auto read from
# the environment variables once instantiated (also when any syncer is called), assuming the environment variable name
# matches the name within the config class (case-insensitive).
# e.g. `Config.aws_endpoint_url` will be auto-filled with the value of `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable.
